# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Core Modules

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide is designed to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, teaching you how to create truly autonomous robotic systems.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured around 5 core modules that progressively build your expertise in Physical AI and embodied intelligence:

1. **ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)** - Establish the communication backbone for robotic systems
2. **Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin)** - Create simulation environments for testing and development
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (AI Robot Brain)** - Implement intelligent decision-making and perception
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrate multimodal AI for real-world interaction
5. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Apply all concepts in a comprehensive final project

Each module includes theoretical foundations, hands-on labs, and practical applications to ensure you gain both conceptual understanding and practical skills.

## Learning Path Structure

The curriculum is designed as a 13-week program with progressive difficulty:

- **Weeks 1-3**: ROS 2 fundamentals and robotic communication
- **Weeks 4-6**: Simulation environments and digital twin concepts
- **Weeks 7-9**: AI brain implementation and perception systems
- **Weeks 10-11**: Vision-language-action integration
- **Weeks 12-13**: Capstone project integration and deployment
