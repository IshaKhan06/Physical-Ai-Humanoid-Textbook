# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

## Project Overview

The capstone project brings together all the concepts learned throughout the textbook to create an autonomous humanoid robot. This comprehensive project integrates ROS 2 communication, simulation environments, AI brain capabilities, and Vision-Language-Action systems into a unified, intelligent robotic platform.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone project, you will have:
- Integrated all five core modules into a cohesive robotic system
- Demonstrated end-to-end functionality of an autonomous humanoid
- Applied systematic engineering practices to complex robotic projects
- Evaluated and validated the performance of your integrated system
- Documented your design decisions and implementation approach

### Project Structure

**Week 12: System Integration**
- Integrating ROS 2 communication across all subsystems
- Connecting simulation and real-world environments
- Establishing communication between AI brain and VLA systems
- Implementing safety protocols and emergency procedures

**Week 13: Validation and Demonstration**
- Testing integrated system functionality
- Demonstrating autonomous behaviors
- Evaluating performance against success criteria
- Preparing project documentation and presentation

## The Autonomous Humanoid Challenge

Your mission is to create a humanoid robot that can:
1. Navigate through a complex environment using perception and planning
2. Understand and respond to natural language commands
3. Manipulate objects in its environment to accomplish tasks
4. Learn from interaction to improve performance over time
5. Operate safely in human-populated environments

The humanoid should demonstrate embodied intelligence by coordinating perception, cognition, and action to achieve complex goals in real-world scenarios.

### Key Integration Challenges

- **System-Level Coordination**: Ensuring all subsystems work harmoniously
- **Real-Time Performance**: Meeting timing constraints across all modules
- **Safety and Reliability**: Implementing robust error handling and safety measures
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Creating intuitive interfaces for human operators
- **Scalability**: Designing systems that can accommodate future enhancements
